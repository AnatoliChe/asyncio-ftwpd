# AsyncIO for the Working Python Developer

Code for the examples on my article in medium [AsyncIO for the Working Python Developer](https://medium.com/@yeraydiazdiaz/asyncio-for-the-working-python-developer-5c468e6e2e8e).

All asyncio examples also come with its corresponding `async/await` version.

The first few examples follow the excellent [Gevent for the Working Python Developer](http://sdiehl.github.io/gevent-tutorial/) tutorial that I broadly followed to introduce [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), I've included the code using gevent for these examples.

You will also find versions of these examples using [Tornado](https://tornadoweb.org), as it was the initial idea was to use it for the article and it's an amazing alternative.

Enjoy!
